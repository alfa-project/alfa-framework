/* Module: MemMU_SR_A
    The MemMU Spherical Representation Address Module::

    The MemMU Spherical Representation Address module is responsible for translating sensor 
    angles to addresses, being this module a sequential approach. Based on the <FOV> and <NUMBER_OF_ADDR_BITS>
    the module tranlate a range of sensor angles into one address. The goal is configure the module so that the sensor
    only output one value for each address, thus the range of angles are the same as the sensor resolution. 
    Also, since ALFA defines linear angular increments that do not reflect the sensor ones, 
    a correction value is also stored to guarantee the maximum resolution possible. For example: For 
    a 360ยบ <FOV> and 11 bits <NUMBER_OF_ADDR_BITS>, the maximum resolution is 360/2^(11)= 0.17578 degrees.
    This means that each address represents the angular value of 0.17578 times the address index. 
    Due to sensors' nonlinear firing paths, the difference in angle between the theoretical and the 
    actual sensor angles is stored as a correction value.
